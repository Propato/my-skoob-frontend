                    This is a project developed by <strong>David Propato</strong>, using <strong>Django</strong> and
                    <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> on the backend, and <strong>Vue.js</strong> with TypeScript on the
                    frontend.

                    The goal is to explore these technologies in a functional project that simulates a real-world
                    application in a simplified way.
